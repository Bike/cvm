This system runs a small subset of the ANSI tests directly related to evaluation semantics on the VM with a client and environment of your choice. This client and environment are passed through to cvm.compile functions and otherwise arbitrary.

For example, to use the basic native client on SBCL, you could do:

(run! nil (make-instance 'trucler-native-sbcl:client))

Eventually there will be more tests, hopefully.
